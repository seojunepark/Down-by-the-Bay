# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Did you ever see a goose
Kissing a moose?"
Down by the bay.

# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the cave
Where the kittens bark
I refuse to se
I dare to never go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Did you ever see a barking kitten 
kissing a grown man?"
Down by the cave.
